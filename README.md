# Sir Trout of the Blackwater Here

How's it going, everyone?

New to coding/programming. Started with the basic HTML and CSS and now working towards learning Javascript. Once I feel comfortable enough working with front-end/back-end website development I plan on giving Python a go. Not exactly sure what I want to commit myself to yet, so I do intend on trying a handful of languages to see what process I end up liking when it comes to development.
